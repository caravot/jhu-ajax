            <p>Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish made from chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine.
                It is a variation of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, of which there are many varieties
                throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English
                families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced.[1] The chicken is coated in flour,
                briefly saut√©ed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce.
                The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or
                shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over
                the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.</p>
